A real example fcomes from the analysis of real operational data from a double ended ferry. Correlation between the thruster allocation, the utilization ratio between forward and aft thruster, was observed. Was this a direct causation or just a common causation, through a hidden variable like for instance the ocean current? 

In order to determine the causation an blinded experiment was carried out.
