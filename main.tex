\section{Method}
A controlled experiment (\autoref{sec:blinded_experiment}) is the classic way to determine the causation. System identification with well established mathematical models, Monte Carlo simulations, and Markov chain analysis are alternatives that can be used for situations where experiments cannot be conducted

\subsection{Controlled experiment}\label{sec:blinded_experiment}
In the controlled experiment, every other trip with Uraniborg was run with two different crews. One crew was operating as normal and the other crew was instructed to only use the aft thruster as much as possible. The same correlation that was seen in \autoref{fig:fuel_consumption_correlation} was observed again during the experiment and a direct causation was concluded that a higher use of the aft thruster will reduce the fuel consumption.
